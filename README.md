This directory contains my solution to the Getting and Cleaning Data assignment in Week 4.

Contents:

* `run_analysis.R` -- the script that downloads and transforms the data
* `results.txt` -- the final result of the assignment, see `CodeBook.html`
* `CodeBook.html` -- describes the variables, the data, and transformations
* `data-raw/` -- directory of the downloaded raw data, created by the script
